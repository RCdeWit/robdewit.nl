				<p>As a <a
				href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7031979898067935233/"
				target="_b ">fresh victim</a> of the recent tech layoffs, I
				suddenly found myself with a lot of time to work on hobby
				projects. One hobby I have recently been neglecting is
				photography. Shooting the photos was never the issue, but
				sorting and editing them certainly is. My recent trip to Chile
				(five stars, had a blast) resulted in about 4000 new photos that
				needed a bit of work. To make matters worse, I still needed to
				edit the album of my summer holiday with Alma. At least now I
				had the time to dive into this properly.</p>

				<p>So what did I do first? Start working on my storage and
				backups, of course. Over the past ten years or so, my collection
				of data has steadily grown to a few terabytes, most of which
				entails photos and videos. I am not one to easily throw away
				data, which has made it progressively more challenging to manage
				my storage of those data.</p>

				<p>Thus far, I have been managing with two external HDDs, a
				backup of all of my raw photos and videos to <a
				href="https://www.transip.nl/stack" target="_blank">TransIP
				Stack</a>, and all sorted material to Google Photos, iCloud, and
				YouTube. Keeping everything in sync proved to be a challenge. As
				a result, I didn't always keep proper backups. I had a bit of a
				scare recently when Veracrypt failed to decrypt my primary HDD,
				and although I managed to fix this, I resolved to set up a
				better system for myself.</p>

				<h2>Hardware setup</h2>

				<p>After some deliberation, I got a NAS with four disks that I
				installed at my office. I set up three disks in <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_RAID_levels"
				target="_blank">RAID5</a>, with the last disk as a hot spare.
				For those who don't know, in a RAID5 storage pool, one disk can
				break without you losing any data. The NAS I bought (<a
				href="https://www.synology.com/en-global/products/DS1522+"
				target="_blank">Synology DS1522+</a>) will automatically start
				using the hot spare in case that happens and bring the fault
				tolerance back up to one disk. From here, I can periodically
				(manually) create back-ups to an external HDD I keep at home. I
				also sync the most important data (sorted and edited photos and
				videos) to Google's and Apple's clouds with <a
				href="https://www.synology.com/en-global/dsm/feature/cloud_sync"
				target="_blank">Synology Cloud Sync</a>.</p>

				<p>While my RAW photos are stored on the NAS, Lightroom needs
				its catalog to be on a local device to work properly. I use
				Synology's <a
				href="https://kb.synology.com/en-global/DSM/help/SynologyDrive/drive_desc?version=7"
				target="b ">Drive Server</a> and <a
				href="https://kb.synology.com/en-global/DSM/help/SynologyDriveClient/synologydriveclient?version=7"
				target="_ ">Drive Client</a> to automatically sync my Lightroom
				catalogs between my laptop and the NAS. It might be quicker to
				keep a local copy of the photos as well, but as it stands, the
				read/write speed isn't the bottleneck in my editing process.</p>

				<p>Is it perfect? No. Two disks could fail at once, my NAS could
				get stolen, I could lose the encryption keys, or Utrecht could
				get nuked. Is it good enough for me? Yes. It provides a happy
				medium between certainty and convenience. In my old situation,
				the certainty was affected by the inconvenience of copying data,
				which caused me not to make backups as often as I should have.
				For now, I am happy with my setup.</p>

				<h2>Remote access with Tailscale</h2>

				<p>After setting up the hardware and transferring my data to the
				server, I had to ensure I could access the server from anywhere.
				The easiest solution for this seemed to be <a
				href="https://tailscale.com/" target="_blank">Tailscale</a>,
				which lets you set up a virtual private network (VPN). Using
				Tailscale saved me the hassle of port forwarding, which probably
				wouldn't work without the appropriate permissions for the
				network in my office building.</p>

				<p>The NAS, my laptop, phone, and home computer are now all part
				of the VPN, so I can access all devices as if they were
				connected to the same WiFi. This doesn't only work for accessing
				all of my photos but also for my next hobby project: running a
				<a href="https://www.plex.tv/" target="_blank">Plex</a> media
				server.</p>

					connections between the author's home, office, and cloud."
					/>
					<span class="subtext">Visual representation of my new setup</span>
				</div>

				<p>Setting up Tailscale was surprisingly easy: I created an
				account, downloaded the app on all my devices, and was good to
				go. The only time I used my CLI was when generating a TLS
				certificate. While this step was not strictly necessary, it
				prevents the annoying "this connection is not secure" warnings
				when accessing the virtual desktop environment of the NAS from
				my browser.</p>

				<h2>Step-by-step instructions</h2>

				<p>In case you're interested in creating a similar setup, here's
				a step-by-step guide. It's based on Synology hardware, but a
				similar approach should be feasible with any NAS.</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li>Install the disks, plug in your NAS, and follow the
					installation wizard.</li>
					<li><a
					href="https://kb.synology.com/en-global/DSM/help/DSM/StorageManager/storage_pool_create_storage_pool?version=7"
					target=" ">Create a storage pool</a> with your required
					specs (for me: RAID5 with one hot spare).</li>
					<li><a
					href="https://kb.synology.com/en-global/DSM/help/DSM/AdminCenter/file_share_create?version=7"
					target="_blank">Create a shared folder</a> (and enable
					encryption).</li>
					<li>Set up <a
					href="https://kb.synology.com/en-global/DSM/help/SynologyDrive/drive_desc?version=7"
					target="b ">Synology Drive Server</a> on the NAS and <a
					href="https://kb.synology.com/en-global/DSM/help/SynologyDriveClient/synologydriveclient?version=7"
					target="_ ">Synology Drive Client</a> on your computer to
					sync your Lightroom catalog (or catalogs) between the
					machines.</li>
					<li>Set up <a href =
					"https://kb.synology.com/en-global/DSM/help/CloudSync/cloudsync?version=7"
					target="_blank">Synology Cloud Sync</a> to create backups of
					your data to the clouds you want (I only did this for my
					most critical data to mitigate costs).</li>
					<li><a href="https://tailscale.com/" target="_blank">Create
					a Tailscale account.</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://tailscale.com/download/" target="_bla
					">Install Tailscale</a> on the NAS and any devices on which
					you want to access your data.</li>
					<li>In the <a
					href="https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines"
					target="_blank">Tailscale admin console</a>, navigate to
					DNS, generate a Tailnet name, and enable MagicDNS. This way,
					you can access devices using machine names instead of IP
					addresses.</li>
					<li>On the DNS page, also enable HTTPS.</li>
					<li>SSH into the NAS from your terminal and run <code>sudo
					tailscale cert</code> to generate a public certificate (I
					<a
					href="https://kb.synology.com/en-id/DSM/tutorial/How_to_login_to_DSM_with_root_permission_via_SSH_Telnet"
					target="_blank">enabled SSH</a> for this and disabled it
					afterward).</li>
				</ol>

				<p>That's all there is to it! Again, I was pleasantly surprised
				by how easy this was to configure. Especially the networking
				aspect with Tailscale was far more straightforward than I had
				anticipated. Now there is nothing to hold me back from finally
				starting on my photo backlog!</p>

				<p>Unless... It could be fun to set up Plex first...</p>
