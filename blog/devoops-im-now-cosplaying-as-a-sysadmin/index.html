        <p>
          For over two years now, I've been hard at work to wrestle control over
          my online life back from tech giants.

            target="_blank"
            >Getting a NAS</a
          >
          was the kick-off to a never-ending project in self-hosting that has
          taught me a great deal about IT and infrastructure. And I've grown
          increasingly confident in taking responsibility for my own online
          self.
        </p>

        <p>
          While I still rely on third parties like Proton, a considerable part
          of my digital life is now fully self-managed. Photos, documents,
          bookmarks, identity: there are
          <a
            href="https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted"
            target="_blank"
            >amazing open-source solutions</a
          >
          for pretty much everything. Aside from the obvious privacy benefits,
          it's also quite liberating. If you don't like the way your email or
          photo archive works, just get a new one!
        </p>

          >
        </div>

        <p>
          To some ‚Äî including my ex-girlfriend¬π‚Äî this endless tinkering sounds
          exhausting. And I agree that it can be a bit stressful to worry about
          your own upgrades and backups. Nonetheless, it pays off to have a full
          picture of where your data lives and which services you use. And I've
          learned a great deal about DevOps principles that help out in my work.
        </p>

        <p>
          With the constant changes to my stack, it's become increasingly
          important to manage everything in a structured manner. That's why my
          goal is to implement everything as Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC). I
          heavily rely on two tools here: Terraform to provision resources and
          PyInfra to configure them. Beyond that, I use GitHub Actions for my
          CI/CD.
        </p>

        <h2>Terraform</h2>

        <p>
          Previously,
          <a
            href="https://robdewit.nl/blog/remote-nas-with-tailscale/"
            target="_blank"
            >I wrote</a
          >
          about how I use Tailscale on a daily basis. Ever since, I've only
          become a much bigger fan. In addition to my own hardware, I now use a
          VPS as a reverse proxy to access my photos and drive over the public
          internet. The term <i>reverse proxy</i> was a bit confusing to me when
          I started out. In short, it's a server that's within my VPN but also
          accessible to visitors not connected to my VPN.
        </p>

        <p>
          This setup allows me to share documents and albums with friends,
          family, and colleagues. Tailscale allows the reverse proxy to connect
          directly to the necessary services ‚Äî and only to those services.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whenever I add a new service to my stack, I can generate an Access
          Control List (ACL) that controls the traffic between my NAS and
          reverse proxy. With Terraform, I can track changes to this file and
          automatically roll them out when needed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Of course, the reverse proxy itself is also managed with Terraform. I
          previously hosted it on Digital Ocean, but recently switched to
          Hetzner (cheaper and EU-based). Swapping out a few Terraform resources
          was a breeze, and within an hour I had a new VPS up and running. That
          included signing up for a Hetzner account.
        </p>

        <h2>PyInfra</h2>

        <p>
          Of course, a VPS by itself doesn't do much: I still needed to
          configure it to serve as my reverse proxy. On Digital Ocean, I had
          configured
          <a href="https://caddyserver.com/" target="_blank">Caddy</a> to
          fulfill this job and route all requests to the right service on my
          NAS. Porting this over was also a few minutes work, because of
          <a href="https://pyinfra.com/" target="_blank">PyInfra</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          PyInfra basically lets you define a series of commands to execute on a
          machine. While Terraform is declarative (‚ÄúI want these components to
          exist‚Äù), PyInfra is imperative (‚ÄúTake these steps to achieve this
          configuration‚Äù). Because I'd captured the commands to set up my
          reverse proxy in a few PyInfra scripts, I could simply run those
          scripts on my new VPS and get the exact same configuration.
        </p>

          <img
            src="./img/pipeline.png"

          />
          <span class="subtext"
            >Factual representation of what a GitHub Actions Workflow looks
            like</span
          >
        </div>

        <h2>GitHub Actions</h2>

        <p>
          Between Terraform and PyInfra, I can fully configure access to my
          self-hosted services. However, I'm prone to making errors when I run a
          bunch of commands. Recently I took the time to set up a true pipeline
          (or <i>workflow</i>) with GitHub Actions. Now, I'm finally at a point
          where I'm happy with the entire setup.
        </p>

        <p>Making changes broadly looks like this:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Make changes to my Terraform and/or PyInfra config</li>
          <li>
            Commit and push the changes to my <code>infra</code> repository
          </li>
          <li>Wait for the deployment to finish</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Of course, the pipeline itself required a bit of setup. You can
          <a
            href="https://github.com/RCdeWit/infra/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml"
            target="_blank"
            >find the configuration itself here</a
          >, but it broadly does the following:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Install dependencies on runner¬≤</li>
          <li>Generate my config files for Tailscale and Caddy</li>
          <li>Validate Terraform plan against the existing state</li>
          <li>Provision and destroy resources if needed</li>
          <li>Extract the IP for the VPS that will host the reverse proxy</li>
          <li>SSH into the VPS</li>
          <li>Execute PyInfra commands to roll out Caddy</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          With all of this running automatically when I change a file or two, I
          don't have to worry about forgetting a command or making a typo
          somewhere. And I can always look up how my stack is configured,
          because the entire configuration is captured in a bunch of text files.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusions</h2>

        <p>
          What started out as hosting my own photo archives, has (d)evolved into
          cosplaying as a sysadmin. Between Terraform, PyInfra, and GitHub
          Actions, I have all the tools I need for a reasonably robust
          deployment pipeline. This gives me the confidence to increasingly
          self-host aspects of my digital life: photos, documents, bookmarks,
          identity management, and who knows what's next?
        </p>

        <p>
          As always, there's still room for improvement. While I manage my
          services with distinct <code>docker-compose</code> files, I currently
          only manage those files within Portainer. My next project will be to
          capture them as part of my <code>infra</code> repository. And the
          subsequent project will be to set up automated deployments for my
          containers as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lastly, there's the configuration of my NAS itself. Synology provides
          a great way to get started, but most of my config has been click-ops'd
          together. If my NAS is stolen or spontaneously bursts into flames, I
          don't have a way to easily replicate my setup ‚Äî aside from restoring a
          backup, of course. At some point, it would be great to replace my NAS
          with a Proxmox or TrueNAS setup.
        </p>

        <p>
          But at that point, I'm unsure whether I'm still <i>cosplaying</i> as a
          sysadmin‚Ä¶

              Although I am comfortable with the "harder" aspects of data
