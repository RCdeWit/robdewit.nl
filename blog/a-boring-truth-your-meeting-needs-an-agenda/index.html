				<p>While I was studying at university I learned a lot of things.
				Many of those things have been of little use after passing the
				exam and have thus mostly been forgotten. If you asked me to
				name Porter's 5 forces or to explain the abstract factory design
				pattern, I'd probably find a good excuse to get out of our
				conversation. I think many people agree that most useful
				knowledge for your work is picked up on the job, whereas
				schoolbook knowledge doesn't translate very well to the real
				world. There is however one thing that I learned while studying
				that I would love to see more of at work.</p>

				<p>During my 7 (oops) years at university I organised a lot of
				events, ranging from conferences to film nights. Most of these
				events were organised in collaboration with fellow students at
				the behest of our study association. While there was plenty of
				time for mucking about, having fun, and drinking a few beers,
				the meetings we had were generally very well structured. Having
				an agenda, note taker, and concrete actions allowed a bunch of
				twenty-somethings to have concise and effective meetings.
				Picture my surprise when it turned out that the grown-up world
				rarely adheres to these simple conventions.</p>

				<p>Perhaps the following situation sounds familiar to you.
				There's something your team needs to discuss and so you schedule
				a meeting sometime next week ‚Äî try finding a time slot that
				works for everyone on a shorter notice. The meeting arrives and
				after talking about everyone's weekend you get to the topic at
				hand. Somewhere along the way you get sidetracked into a
				disagreement on details, and ten minutes before your next
				meeting it turns out you haven't gotten to the material decision
				yet. This prompts you to rush through the issue that actually
				needed discussing. As it turns out there was little to discuss
				in the first place, and half of the people there need not have
				attended. Somehow you still spent an hour.</p>

				<p>With everyone working remotely this situation has become even
				more frequent. What used to be a 5 minute check-in at your
				colleague's desk has turned into a standard 30-minute meeting.
				Some basic meeting etiquette can help mitigate the inevitable
				frustration that arises from this. Moreover, it provides a solid
				boost to your productivity.</p>

				<p>Here's the 3 must haves I propose for your meetings:</p>

				<div class="focuscontent">
					<h3>1. Have an agenda</h3>

					<p>Agreeing upon an agenda allows you to identify what
					everyone wants to get out of the meeting. If you share the
					agenda in advance it allows invitees to see whether they
					have anything to contribute to the discussion. Additionally,
					it allows us to "park" discussions that distract from the
					topic at hand and contain them in a dedicated agenda
					item.</p>

					<p>A generic template can be as easy as follows:</p>

					<ol>
						<li>Check in: discuss what's on everyone's mind and if
						there's something worth sharing;</li>
						<li>Setting the agenda: add or remove items that the
						attendees want to discuss;</li>
						<li>Previous actions: discuss the outcomes of previous
						actions and re-prioritise actions that have fallen by
						the wayside;</li>
						<li>[Material points]: the point of the meeting;</li>
						<li>Any other business (A.O.B.): points that came up
						throughout the meeting and are still worth
						discussing;</li>
						<li>Check out: final comments, questions, and remarks by
						attendees.</li>
					</ol>

					<p>Of course you can tweak it wherever you feel necessary.
					Find a structure that works for your team and adjust it on
					the fly. The important part is having a common ground that
					everyone agrees upon, not the specifics of the agenda
					items.</p>

					<h3>2. Have someone enforce the agenda</h3>

					<p>I know, I know... We are all adults and no one likes a
					chair waving their hammer around. Regardless, it helps to
					have someone that keeps an eye on the clock and cuts off
					discussions when they are going sideways ‚Äî or worse: in
					circles. Generally this will be the person who calls the
					meeting, but be open to other people as well. Especially
					when the organiser has a high stake in the discussion, it
					can be worthwhile to have a somewhat impartial
					"referee".</p>

					<h3>3. Have someone take notes</h3>

					<p>Find a volunteer (or "volunteer") to take notes during
					the meeting. You can make the notes as elaborate as you
					want, but make sure to at least record decisions and
					actions. Actions should be <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria"
					target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">as SMART as possible</a>,
					and at least contain an assignee, concrete outcome, and
					deadline. The action items (AIs) can generally be discussed
					in a follow-up meeting, or can be input for your issue
					tracker. Please note that <i>"AI Everyone: think
					about..."</i> results in everyone saying they thought about
					it and no one producing any ideas.</p>
				</div>

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>With these three must haves I think your meetings can be far
				more effective. It's a strange world when a committee of
				volunteering students can be more concise and structured than a
				team of well-paid professionals. Let it be said that all of this
				comes from someone who is not naturally structured. In classic
				colour tests I generally come up as "red", with "blue"
				behaviours being a coping mechanism for stress rather than a
				natural inclination. Nevertheless, I have found that adhering to
				the guidelines above has a positive effect on what I get out of
				my meetings. Bonus: your colleagues will thank you for it as
				well.</p>

						solve problems. Although I am comfortable with the
						"harder" aspects of data engineering and data science, I
						firmly believe that tech shouldn't be self-serving. What
						I like doing best is connecting with people, sharing
